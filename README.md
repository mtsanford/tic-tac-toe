tic-tac-toe
===========

Multiplayer crossbrowser tic-tac-toe game using node.js, socket.io, and jquery-mobile.

This is just the game server (game-server.js), which exposes a socket to interact with the game logic and other players.

There is also a robot script (game-robots.js), which interacts with the game server exactly as a web client would.
game-robots.js ensures that there are always 2 robot players availabe with which to test one's tic-tac-toe mettle.

The simple web client for the game is in /webclient.
